YAPE stands for Yet Another Physics Engine, and a really bad one, at that.
It's a 2D physics engine written in Java with an API that lets you generate "stages" for the engine.

Some demo is available in it, with a game where you have to send a ball in a flag zone.

This project was made for a class, and used JavaFX, which is no longer supported natively.
